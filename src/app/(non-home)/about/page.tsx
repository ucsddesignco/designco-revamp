          <h2>What is Design Co?</h2>
          <p>
            Design Co is a pre-professional student organization at UC San Diego
            that bridges the gap between designers and industry. Our mission is
            to cultivate a space that fosters opportunity and growth as an
            inclusive community of designers.

        <li>
          <h2>What does the “Co” in Design Co mean?</h2>
          <p>
            The “Co” means Community, Collective, and Collaborative, which is
            everything we stand for. We believe that fostering an inclusive
            design community means collaborating with others and growing with
            everyone.
